:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Introduction
:END:

This is the master document for my resumes, CVs, etc.
It is constructable to present roughly the same
in both PDF and HTML export, as well as looking decent
in Github's rendering of markdown and Org.

This is accomplished by sticking mostly to pure Org,
with a good amount of LaTeX and HTML/CSS header setup
and some small LaTeX and HTML snippets to control document flow.

* User information                              :noexport:

I choose to include an image in the footer of my HTML documents.
Usually I make it part of the ~author~ keyword,
but because that is used in the title here,
I make a special keyword to store the HTML code for the image.
#+HTML_footer_image: <img src="me.jpg" alt="Mark Armstrong" style="width:200px">

* Org, LaTeX, HTML, CSS settings                :noexport:
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Settings
:END:

** Org settings
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Org-settings
:END:

We manually enter a ‚Äútitle‚Äù, so do not put title, author, or date.
#+Options: title:nil author:nil date:nil

Also do not put in a table of contents or number sections.
#+Options: toc:nil num:nil

*** LaTeX Org export settings
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: LaTeX-Org-export-settings
:END:

For ease of customisability, here we define
a new ~org-latex-class~ which maps headings to
our own custom commands, defined below.
This means we avoid having to redefine the ~\(sub)section~ commands.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports results :results none :eval export
(make-variable-buffer-local 'org-latex-hyperref-template)
(add-to-list
  'org-latex-classes
    '("resume"
      "\\documentclass{article}"
      ("\\sectionhead{%s}" . "\\sectionhead{%s}") ;; Same with or without numbering
      ("\\subsectionhead{%s}" . "\\subsectionhead{%s}")))
#+end_src
R√©sum√©s should not be deeply nested, so we only
give two levels here. Lower levels would become lists.

** Common settings
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Shared-settings
:END:

*** Colours
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Colours
:END:

In LaTeX, we need ~xcolor~ to give us ~definecolor~.
#+LaTeX_header: \usepackage{xcolor}
In the HTML, we should be in a ~style~ block
so we can declare colour variables for the CSS.
#+HTML_head: <style>

I personally prefer to use gray's. Nice and printer friendly!
But you are free to set whatever colours you wish.

First, in LaTeX. The ~HTML~ method lets us set the colour
using a hex code.
#+LaTeX_header: \definecolor{section}   {HTML}{80ADA3}
#+LaTeX_header: \definecolor{subsection}{HTML}{EAEAEA}
#+LaTeX_header: \definecolor{sidebar}   {HTML}{FAFAFA}

Now in CSS.
#+HTML_head: :root { --section:    #80ADA3; }
#+HTML_head: :root { --subsection: #EAEAEA; }
#+HTML_head: :root { --sidebar:    #FAFAFA; }

Note: I would extract the settings into a macro,
but unfortunately Org macros don't expand in these settings. üôÅ

Close the ~style~ block.
#+HTML_head: </style>

*** Macros                                    :noexport:
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Macros
:END:

These macros allow us to accomplish certain tasks inline
simultaneously in HTML and in LaTeX,
such as right alignment and fontification.

**** Title (name) macros                     :noexport:
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Title-(name)-macros
:END:

Here, we introduce a sequence of Org macros to
wrap the ‚Äútitle‚Äù (my name) in HTML and LaTeX fontication.
This saves us putting an obscenely long line below.

First, code to fontify the title in HTML.
#+Macro: htmlize-title @@html:<div class=the-title>@@$1 @@html:</div>@@

This macro forces LaTeX text to be treated as having zero height;
this way, we can add larger text into tables without affecting the row height.
#+Macro: latex-zero-height @@latex:\raisebox{0pt}[0pt][0pt]{@@$1 @@latex:}@@

Then, code to ‚Äúhugify‚Äù LaTeX text.
#+Macro: latex-hugify @@latex:{\huge @@$1 @@latex:}@@

Combine the LaTeX ‚Äúzero height‚Äù and ‚Äúhugify‚Äù macros to ‚ÄúLaTeXify‚Äù
the title.
#+Macro: latexify-title {{{latex-zero-height({{{latex-hugify($1)}}})}}}

Now, combine all those macros along with the ~author~ macro to create the title.
#+Macro: resume-title {{{latexify-title({{{htmlize-title({{{author}}})}}})}}}

**** Right alignment
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: HOrizontal-fillers
:END:

This macro right aligns its content;
in LaTeX, this is accomplished by ~hfill~'ing on the left,
and in HTML, we use a right-aligned span.
Just remember to escape any commas.
#+Macro: right-align @@latex:\hfill @@@@html:<span style="padding-left:3em; float:right">@@$1@@html:</span>@@

**** Scriptnotes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Table-(foot)notes
:END:

Use of footnotes is not ideal here, since they are placed at
the bottom of the page/site. This macro instead makes a small note
in place. Numbering is manual, though.

#+Macro: scriptnote @@html:<span style="font-size:0.5rem">@@@@latex:{\scriptsize@@$1@@latex:}@@@@html:</span>@@

** LaTeX header
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ‚ÄúGlobal‚Äù-LaTeX-header-settings
:END:

*** Page layout
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Page-layout
:END:

First, we'll use the ~resume~ class defined in [[LaTeX Org export settings]].
It's definition is added to ~org-latex-classes~ on export.
#+LaTeX_class: resume
#+LaTeX_class_options: [10pt]

Don't show page numbers.
#+LaTeX_header: \pagenumbering{gobble}

We use ~geometry~ to decrease the margin size;
the defaults for ~article~ are very large.
Add ~showframe~ to the options to visualise the margins.
#+LaTeX_header: \usepackage[margin=0.5in]{geometry}

**** Columns
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Columns
:END:

I like a small column on the right of the first page
to contain some point form information.
We accomplish that by using the ~paracol~ package;
an excellent package which supports exactly the settings
I want for the sidebar.
#+LaTeX_header: \usepackage{paracol}

In particular,

*** Section headers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Section-headers
:END:

We'll use ~tcolorbox~ to highlight the section and subsection headers
with a background colour.
#+LaTeX_header: \usepackage[most]{tcolorbox}

Specifically, we want simple rectangles without coloured borders
and with a customisable background colour.
#+LaTeX_header: \newtcolorbox{bgbox}[2][]{
The box should fill the whole horizontal area
‚Äîthe whole page or column.
#+LaTeX_header:   width=\linewidth,
Don't have any internal margins in the box.
#+LaTeX_header:   left=0pt, right=0pt, top=0pt, bottom=0pt,
Colour both the frame and its background the same.
#+LaTeX_header:   colback=#2, colframe=#2,
Don't round the corners.
#+LaTeX_header:   arc=0pt,outer arc=0pt,
#+LaTeX_header:   }

Section headers appropriately use our ~section~ colour.
Also, make the font large.
#+LaTeX_header: \newcommand{\sectionhead}[1]{%
#+LaTeX_header:   \begin{bgbox}{section}%
#+LaTeX_header:     {\Large \textsf{#1}}%
#+LaTeX_header:   \end{bgbox}%
#+LaTeX_header: }

Subsection headers are similar, but use a smaller font size
‚Äîsmaller than normal, because these are often quite long.
#+LaTeX_header: \newcommand{\subsectionhead}[1]{%
#+LaTeX_header:   \begin{bgbox}{subsection}%
#+LaTeX_header:     {\small \textsf{#1}}%
#+LaTeX_header:   \end{bgbox}%
#+LaTeX_header: }

*** Lists
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Lists
:END:

Remove the spacing around lists and between list items.
#+LaTeX_header: \usepackage[shortlabels]{enumitem}
#+LaTeX_header: \setlist{nosep}

Redefine the bullets to nice unicode characters.
The first one here is actually the default, but redefine it anyway.
#+LaTeX_header: \renewcommand{\labelitemii}{‚ñª}
#+LaTeX_header: \renewcommand{\labelitemii}{‚ñª}

*** Paragraphs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Paragraphs
:END:

Don't indent paragraphs.
#+LaTeX_header: \setlength{\parindent}{0em}

*** Hyperlinks
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Hyperlinks
:END:

Override the ~hypersetup~ settings for this file;
I have inserted links, but don't want them coloured in the PDF.
They'd be eyesores if printed.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports results :results none :eval export
(make-variable-buffer-local 'org-latex-hyperref-template)
(setq org-latex-hyperref-template
  "\\hypersetup{colorlinks=false}\n")
#+end_src

** CSS
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: CSS
:END:

*** Header
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Header
:END:

Start the style section of the HTML header.
#+HTML_head: <style>

*** Page layout
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Page-layout
:END:

As stated in the [[Columns]] portion of the LaTeX settings,
I like a small column on the right of the first page
to contain some point form information.
We accomplish that by using ~float~'s in the HTML.

Note the sizing set here: 23% of the page for the sidebar,
and 73% for the content to its left.
This gives a small gap. Without that, the elements tend to overlap
at certain window sizes.

The sidebar does not look good if the window is too narrow,
such as when the page is loaded on a phone.
We can use media queries to set the CSS
for the sidebar based on the window width.
When the window is narrow, just treat it
‚Äîand the content left of it‚Äî
normally.
#+HTML_head: .left-of-sidebar {}
#+HTML_head: .sidebar {}

When we're in a wide window, set up the sidebar.
#+HTML_head: @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
#+HTML_head:   .sidebar {
#+HTML_head:     float: right;
#+HTML_head:     width: 25%;
#+HTML_head:     background-color: var(--sidebar);
#+HTML_head:   }
#+HTML_head:   .left-of-sidebar {
#+HTML_head:     float: left;
#+HTML_head:     width: 7   3%;
#+HTML_head:   }
#+HTML_head: }

*** Section headers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Section-headers
:END:

Sections are exported as ~h2~'s.
with sans-serif font, unbolded.
#+HTML_head: h2 {
#+HTML_head:   font-family:      sans-serif;
#+HTML_head:   font-weight:      normal;
Use the ~--section~ colour we created above.
#+HTML_head:   background-color: var(--section);
Also put a little space on the left and right.
#+HTML_head:   padding-left:     0.5em;
#+HTML_head:   padding-right:    0.5em;
Don't take up the whole width; they overlap other elements
sometimes if we set it to 100%.
#+HTML_head:   width:            95%;
Display as an inline block, so if a linebreak is necessary,
the background colour is also applied to the newline.
#+HTML_head:   display:          inline-block;
#+HTML_head: }

Subsections are similar, just using their own colour.
#+HTML_head: h3 {
#+HTML_head:   font-family:      sans-serif;
#+HTML_head:   font-weight:      normal;
#+HTML_head:   background-color: var(--subsection);
#+HTML_head:   padding-left:     0.5em;
#+HTML_head:   padding-right:    0.5em;
#+HTML_head:   width:            95%;
#+HTML_head:   display:          inline-block;
#+HTML_head: }

*** The title (my name)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: The-title-(my-name)
:END:

The title is placed in a table, with the right column
of the table being various contact information.

In order to increase the fontsize of the title,
without increasing the size of the row it is in,
we set its ~line-height~ to 0, and set
both ~white-space~ to ~nowrap~ and ~overflow~ to ~visible~ so that
it is still displayed normally.

As with the sidebar, a large title text can be problematic
in small windows. So, we set the size conditionally.

For small windows, only increase the size to 150%.
#+HTML_head:   .the-title {
#+HTML_head:     font-size: 1.5rem;
#+HTML_head:     line-height: 0;
#+HTML_head:     white-space: nowrap;
#+HTML_head:     overflow: visible;
#+HTML_head:   }

In large windows, up it to 300%.
#+HTML_head: @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
#+HTML_head:   .the-title {
#+HTML_head:     font-size: 3rem;
#+HTML_head:   }
#+HTML_head: }

*** Footer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Footer
:END:

End the style section of the HTML header.
#+HTML_head: </style>

** HTML postamble
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: HTML-postamble
:END:

I add some details to the typical HTML postamble.
In particular, my image, contact email, and the means
by which the page was generated ‚ÄîEmacs and Org.

#+Name: the-author
{{{author}}}

#+Name: the-image

** Documentation                               :noexport:

:CUSTOM_ID: Documentation
:END:

The title is simply an Org table, with my name
inserted large in the first column using the ~resume-title~ macro.

Below my name is my title, and on the right
is various contact information.

For the LaTeX, we use the ~tabularx~ environment
in order to better control table and column widths.

For the HTML, we must specify ~:frame void~ or a frame is drawn,
ruining the illusion that this is a carefully constructed
title layout. üòÄ

Note the use of Org table cookies for column alignments
and groupings; there is a single vertical rule between
the name of the contact information and the information itself.
The alignment is repeated in the LaTeX attributes
in order to have the left column take up all remaining space.

I'm not certain it's advisable to include an image in my resume;
in particular, it would mean I should produce a ‚Äúprinter friendly‚Äù
version, and probably having two versions is an irritation.
Instead, I will place it in the HTML footer, since that is not
intended for printing.
